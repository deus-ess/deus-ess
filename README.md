# Status
**What's Happenin'?**

Moving all my main day-to-day machines from GNOME to Stumpwm.</br>In-practice doing clean installs, because want to know the process from </br>"Standard" Debian to a semi-workable / liveable config for [Clebian](https://github.com/cloghouse/clebian) x [Bark](https://github.com/cloghouse/bark).


**Currently, I'm Working On:**

- Learning Common-Lisp in pursuit of investing deeply into [CLOG](https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog).
- Finish the restructing of my Github account (I'd say I'm 80% there).
- Start self-hosting most of clog.house's live-demo stack.
