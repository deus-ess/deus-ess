# Status
**What's Happenin'?**

First-big and ... hopefully last snow-storm of the year hit Saint Louis. </br>2nd day in a row I'm about to clear two double-car driveways of snow. lol </br>So very little progress on here the next few days prob tbh, as big-boy recovers.


**Currently, I'm Working On:**

- Learning Common-Lisp in pursuit of investing deeply into [CLOG](https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog).
- Finish the restructing of my Github account (I'd say I'm 80% there).
- Start self-hosting most of clog.house's live-demo stack.
